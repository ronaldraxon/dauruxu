J	Ben-Ami, N; Korn, L				Ben-Ami, Noa; Korn, Liat			Associations between backache and stress among undergraduate students	JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH			English	Article						Low back pain (LBP); undergraduate students; stress; depression symptoms	PAIN; RISK	Objective: Low back pain (LBP) is a very common symptom. It occurs in all age groups from children to the elderly population. Globally, years lived with disability caused by LBP increased by 54% between 1990 and 2015. Our objective was to investigate measures that associate with LBP in students. Participants: A structured, anonymous, self-report questionnaire was distributed in two study years, 2009 and 2015. Participants included 1,026 students, 57.7% of them female, with a mean age of 27.2 (SD = 6.4). Methods: The questionnaire included validated questions on various subjects related to health status and health behaviors. Results: The associated factors of undergraduate students experiencing backaches are higher if they engage in smoking (AOR = 2.15; p<.01), report study-based stress (AOR = 2.39; p<.01), and show depressive symptoms (AOR = 2.69; p<.000). Conclusions: Smoking, stress, and depression are strong measures associated with backache in undergraduate students, significantly more than BMI, physical activity, or sedentary behaviors.

The relationship between sleep quality, stress, and academic performance among medical students	JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEDICINE			English	Article						Academic performance; medical education; medical students; sleep; sleep quality; stress	COLLEGE-STUDENTS; ASSOCIATION; DEPRIVATION; PREVALENCE; INSOMNIA; INDEX	BACKGROUND: Sleep is essential for the body, mind, memory, and learning. However, the relationship between sleep quality, stress, and academic performance has not been sufficiently addressed in the literature. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of sleep and psychological stress among medical students and investigate the relationship between sleep quality, stress, and academic performance.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study targeted all medical students in their preclinical years at a Saudi medical college in 2019. All students were asked to complete an electronic self-administered questionnaire comprising the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), questions on the students' current overall grade point average, and other demographic and lifestyle factors. The associations between categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-squared test at 0.05 significance level.RESULTS: The mean PSQI score was 8.13 +/- 3.46; 77% of the participants reported poor quality of sleep and 63.5% reported some level of psychological stress (mean K10 score: 23.72 +/- 8.55). Poor quality of sleep was significantly associated with elevated mental stress levels (P < 0.001) and daytime naps (P = 0.035). Stepwise logistic regression model showed that stress and daytime nap were associated with poor sleep quality. Whereas, poor sleep or stress did not show any significant association with academic performance.CONCLUSION: Poor sleep quality was significantly associated with elevated levels of strees. However, they did not show any statistically significant relationship with academic performance.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine through logistic regression if the independent variables (risk factors) such as (X1) age, (X2) sex, (X3) marital status, (X4) number of children, and (X5) occupation have influence on the dependent variables such as lifestyles, depression, anxiety, and stress in Peruvian nursing students. The research study was descriptive, transversal, and prospective; 1193 nursing students from Chorrillos, Ica, and Chincha were evaluated, which constituted the total population for the 2018 semester. The Health Promoting Life Profile-II (HPLP-II) and the Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were used as instruments. 53.9% of nursing students had unhealthy lifestyles; however, they presented moderate (19.7%), slight (14.2%), severe (2.5%), and extremely severe (2.4%) anxiety. With respect to depression, it was found that 61.2% and 59.9% of affected students were stressed. A significant association was found only between depression and age (p=0.040) and OR=2.0 (95% CI 1.3-3.1), anxiety and marital status (p=0.043) and OR=1.7 (95% CI 1.0-2.6), and lifestyles and sex of the students (p=0.003) and OR=1.1 (95% CI 1.1-2.3). Finally, it is concluded that Peruvian nursing students showed levels of anxiety ranging from moderate to extremely severe, while most of them had "normal" states of depression and stress and also showed unhealthy lifestyles.

Participants: Thai university students were selected (N?=?478) during November 2016 using random cluster sampling. Methods: A health and well-being questionnaire was constructed, translated from English to Thai, back-translated, and pilot tested. Descriptive and chi-square statistics were calculated for study variables. Results: Thai male students had lower happiness and psychological well-being than Thai female students. Overall, Thai students had lower happiness and higher perceived stress than US/UK samples. Thai male students reported greater alcohol and tobacco use than Thai female students. Overall, Thai students reported inadequate diet (57%), poor sleep quantity/quality (67%) and depressive symptoms (40%). Conclusions: These preliminary results identify specific areas of concern in the health and well-being of Thai university students. Further analyses are needed to shed light on the factors contributing to these increased health risks.

Perceived stress and eating behavior among professional and nonprofessional undergraduate students in Udupi District, Karnataka	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Eating behavior; perceived stress; professional and nonprofessional colleges; undergraduate students		Background: Stress is an unavoidable part of our life. Certain amount of stress is needed for our survival. Stress is one of the factors, which affects the health and eating habits of a person. Objectives: The aim of the study was to compare the perceived stress among professional and nonprofessional undergraduate students and to find out the relationship between eating behavior and perceived stress of undergraduate students. Methods: A comparative descriptive study was conducted from November 2017 to April 2018, among 400 undergraduate students from selected professional and nonprofessional colleges in Udupi District, Karnataka. Students were recruited using proportionate sampling technique. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire after obtaining informed consent of the study participants. Results: Statistically significant difference was found in perceived stress of professional and nonprofessional students (Z = -2.397, P = 0.017). There was a weak positive correlation between perceived stress and uncontrolled eating of professional students (rho= 0.162, P = 0.022) and nonprofessional students (rho= 0.183, P = 0.009). There was no association found between perceived stress and selected demographic variables such as age, gender, study course, year of study, type of family, and occupation of parents (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Perceived stress of professional students is more compared to nonprofessional students. Uncontrolled eating behavior is influenced by increase in stress, and perceived stress is independent of demographic variables.

J	McCloud, T; Bann, D				McCloud, Tayla; Bann, David			Financial stress and mental health among higher education students in the UK up to 2018: rapid review of evidence	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Review						Debt; financial stress; mental health; higher education	PHYSICAL HEALTH; DEBT; CIRCUMSTANCES; DIFFICULTIES; IMPACT	Introduction In the United Kingdom and many other countries, debt accrued during higher education has increased substantially in recent decades. The prevalence of common mental health problems has also increased alongside these changes. However, it is as yet unclear whether there is an association between financial stress and mental health among higher education students. Methods We conducted a rapid review of the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Eligible studies were English-language publications testing the association between any indicator of financial stress and mental health among higher education students in the UK. Papers were located through a systematic search of PsychINFO, PubMed and Embase up to November 2018. Results The search strategy yielded 1272 studies-9 met the inclusion criteria. A further two were identified through hand-searching. The median sample size was 408. Only three of seven studies found an association between higher debt and worse mental health. There was a consistent cross-sectional relationship between worse mental health and both experience of financial difficulties (seven of seven studies) and debt worry/financial concern (four of five studies), though longitudinal evidence was mixed and limited to six studies. Conclusion Among higher education students in the UK, there is little evidence that the amount of debt is associated with mental health. However, more subjective measures of increased financial stress were more consistently associated with worse mental health outcomes. Nevertheless, the identified evidence was judged to be weak; further research is required to examine whether links between financial stress and mental health outcomes are robust and causal in nature.

Research was conducted at two Division I universities in the southeastern United States. Participants were given the Sport Locus of Control and Perceived Stress among College Athletes surveys. There were 126 participants with a mean age of 19.69 +/- 1.32 years. A Pearson correlation (r) was performed to determine a significant relationship between perceived stress and locus of control. Results indicated a significant negative relationship between the two variables (r = -0.393 and p = 0.001) (a moderate relationship). As perceived stress scores increased, locus of control scores decreased. Correlations related to perceived stress were gender (r = 0.323, p = 0.000), and grade point average (GPA) (r = -0.213, p = 0.01). The only other independent variable that was significantly related to locus of control was being on an academic scholarship (r = -0.203, p = 0.025). Athletes who have an external locus of control feel that they have little control over their circumstances. Findings of this study give coaches another factor to consider in retaining and getting the most from their athletes.

The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Trier Inventory of Chronic Stress (TICS) were used. The results show that one out of 3 students suffer from a lot of to extreme stress. One-fourth of the students report feeling overworked and socially overburdened. More than half of the students are exposed to psychosocial drain as a consequence of past events in their biography (e.g. death or mental illness of a close relative). Despite these obvious burdens, only one-fourth made use of professional aid or counseling. Students who are primarily using functional coping strategies have a lower sensibility to stress and feel less overworked than students primarily using dysfunctional coping strategies. In the university setting, the theoretically and empirically sound knowledge based on this report can be used profitably: The increasing implementation of seminars on coping with stress at universities itself suggests that learning and utilizing functional coping strategies can contribute to a reduction of stress and strain among students.

Method/design: This study is being conducted in six states within Peninsular Malaysia. From each state, schools from each district are randomly selected and invited to participate in the study. Once the schools agree to participate, all teachers who fulfilled the inclusion criteria are invited to participate. Data collection includes a questionnaire survey and health assessment. Information collected in the questionnaire includes socio-demographic characteristics, participants' medical history and family history of chronic diseases, teaching characteristics and burden, questions on smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activities (IPAQ); a food frequency questionnaire, the job content questionnaire (JCQ); depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS21); health related quality of life (SF12-V2); Voice Handicap Index 10 on voice disorder, questions on chronic pain, sleep duration and obstetric history for female participants. Following blood drawn for predefined clinical tests, additional blood and urine specimens are collected and stored for future analysis. Active follow up of exposure and health outcomes will be carried out every two years via telephone or face to face contact. Data collection started in March 2013 and as of the end of March 2014 has been completed for four states: Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Melaka and Penang. Approximately 6580 participants have been recruited. The first round of data collection and blood sampling is expected to be completed by the end of 2014 with an expected 10,000 participants recruited. Discussion: Our study will provide a good basis for exploring the clustering of lifestyle risk factors and stress and its association with major chronic medical conditions such as obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart diseases, kidney failure and cancers among teachers.

Civilization changes of the environment shaping the psychosocial resources from rural to urban influence human health. Aim. The study aimed to identify the differences due to the place of residence (rural, urban) as far as health resources are concerned (social support, sense of coherence, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentration in plasma) and health in examination stress situations. The study also determined the concentration of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (health resource) and cortisol (stress indicator). Material and methods. The psychosocial variables were assessed using the scales: ISEL-48v. Coll., SOC-29, SF-36v.2 (TM) oand analogue scale (perception of examination stress). The study included, based on a stratified sampling (year of study) and purposive sampling (written examination, major), 731 students representing the six universities in Lublin, south-east Poland. Among the respondents, 130 students were rural residents. Results. Health resources of students living in rural and urban areas generally differ statistically significantly in social support and the subscales of availability oftangible support, availability of appreciative support, the availability of cognitive-evaluative support and a sense of resourcefulness. The study recorded a sstatistically significantly larger network of family ties among students living in rural areas. The demonstrated diversity of resources did not substantially affect the perceived health, with the exception of pain sensation. Examination stress assessed by subjective opinion of the respondents and plasma cortisol levels vary relative to the place of residence. Students residing in rural areas showed significantly lower cortisol levels values, but subjectively perceived the situation of examation as more stressful. Conclusions. Differences in health resources and their mechanism of impact on health, to a limited extent, were conditioned by the place of residence, but they are so important in the light of human choices that they require further analysis.

Psycho-social sources of stress and burnout in schools: research on a sample of italian teachers	MEDICINA DEL LAVORO			Italian	Article						Stress; burnout; teachers	WORK ENGAGEMENT; SELF-EFFICACY; OCCUPATIONAL STRESS; JOB BURNOUT; RESOURCES; DIMENSIONS; PREDICTORS; EXPERIENCE; EMPLOYEE; DEMANDS	Background: Numerous studies show the existence of stress and burnout among teachers. The psycho-social sources of stress and burnout in teachers cover many aspects, often of conflictual nature, affecting the relationship with the school organization, colleagues, parents, students, and many other variables. Objective: This study aimed at exploring the incidence of burnout among teachers in primary and secondary schools and to describing the characteristics of burnout taking into account the educational level, the location of the school and the teacher's length of service. Another objective of this study was to identify, among the principal sources of teachers' job stress, those sources that are more able to predict the occurrence of burnout. Among these predictors of stress we considered the personal image of the teacher with respect to the work-family interface and the gap between professional and social status. Methods: 882 teachers from the cities of Rome, Bari, Cagliari and Sassari completed the Maslach burnout Inventory (MBI), and an adaptation to the school environment of the OSI (Organizational Stress Indicator, Cooper, Sloan & Williams). The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression and analysis of the multivariate variance. Results: 29.9% of the teachers surveyed presented high levels of emotional exhaustion, 33.8% had the highest scores of depersonalization; 28.3% had a low level of professional achievement; 8.2% of the teachers were in burnout. Interpersonal conflict and personal image were included among the predictors of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Conclusions: The study highlights the existence of burnout among teachers and the need for prevention, particularly against depersonalization, that affects the quality of both the teacher-student relationship and the teaching-learning process.

Promoting Psychosocial Adjustment and Stress Management in First-Year College Students: The Benefits of Engagement in a Psychosocial Wellness Seminar	JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH			English	Article						college students; intervention; mental health; promotion; wellness	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; MENTAL-HEALTH-SERVICES; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; PERCEIVED STRESS; MEDICAL-STUDENTS; ANXIETY; INTERVENTION	Objective/Methods: This research evaluates the effectiveness of a psychosocial wellness seminar for first-year college students, from 2009 to 2011, using an 8-month prospective quasi-experimental design. Participants/Results: Compared with controls (n = 22) involved in an alternative seminar, intervention participants (n = 29) showed no differences at baseline, but reported significantly greater perceived improvements over the course of the intervention, in psychosocial adjustment and stress management. Furthermore, specific aspects of intervention engagement (attendance and student-rated skills practice, but not didactic mastery or facilitator-rated skills practice) differentially predicted beneficial outcomes: (1) psychosocial adjustment (increases in psychosocial well-being, decreases in psychological distress), after adjusting for baseline levels of these outcomes; (2) college-related stress management (lower college-related stress, greater adaptation to college); and (3) perceived improvements in psychosocial adjustment and stress management. Conclusions: This research indicates promising avenues for programmatic efforts to promote psychosocial adjustment and stress management in college students, during this critical developmental juncture.
