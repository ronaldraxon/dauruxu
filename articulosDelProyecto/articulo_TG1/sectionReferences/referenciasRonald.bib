Additionally, some individual characteristics influence susceptibility to burnout (e.g., neuroticism). Therefore, the question arises whether burnout is or is not a distinct syndrome. The aim of the study is to compare 2 distinct burnout measures by analyzing their connections with organizational and individual variables.  Material and methods The study was conducted in the Institute of Applied Psychology at the Jagiellonian University, Kraków, Poland on a group of employees (N = 100; 40 men; mean age 36.03 years). All participants completed 2 burnout scales: the  Maslach Burnout Inventory – General Survey  (MBI-GS) and the  Link Burnout Questionnaire  (LBQ). Organizational and individual factors were controlled with  Areas of Worklife Survey ,  State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ,  NEO Five-Factor Inventory  and  Beck’s Depression Inventory  scales. A structural equation path model was created to quantify the relations between organizational factors and burnout, as well as to control the individual factors of anxiety, neuroticism and depression.  Results The results indicate high compatibility between MBI-GS and LBQ on burnout diagnosis. The MBI-GS and LBQ revealed stronger connections with organizational context and individual characteristics, respectively. Depression explains dimensions of exhaustion (MBI-GS, LBQ), sense of disillusion (LBQ), neuroticism–exhaustion (MBI-GS); anxiety explains sense of professional inefficacy (LBQ).  Conclusions Besides organizational variables, individual characteristics also play an important role in explaining burnout syndrome. Exploring the 2 burnout models has revealed that depression is an important determinant of exhaustion.

abstract = "Objectives. This study examined the relation between occupational variables and 3 forms of depression (major depressive episode, depressive syndrome, and dysphoria). It was hypothesized that individuals working in occupations with high psychologic strain (high psychologic demands and low decision authority) would have a higher prevalence of depression relative to those working in occupations with the other 3 possible conditions. Methods. The analysis was based on data for 905 respondents who were employed full-time in the year before the follow-up interview for the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program in Baltimore, Md, between 1993 and 1996. Psychosocial work environment, socio-demographic variables, and psycho-pathology were assessed in a household interview that included the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Subscales for the demand-control model for psychosocial work environment were modified slightly after factor analysis. Results. High job strain was associated with greater prevalence of all 3 forms of depression, especially major depressive episode. The results were stronger for women; for men, being unmarried was the strongest prevalence correlate. Conclusions. Major depressive episode, depressive syndrome, and dysphoria are strongly associated with the psychosocial dimensions of the demand-control model.",

The effective early detection of a drowsiness state can help provide a timely warning for drivers, but previous studies have seldom considered the cumulative effect of drowsiness over time. The purpose of this study is therefore to establish a model to detect a driver's drowsiness level by considering individual differences combined with the time cumulative effect (TCE) of drowsiness. Driving behavior and eye movement data from 27 drivers were collected by a driving simulator with an eye-tracking system, and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) was used to record drivers’ perceptions of their states of drowsiness. Since the degree of driver drowsiness was shown to increase with time, a mixed-effect ordered logit (MOL) model was established, and a non-decreasing function of time was applied to consider time accumulation. Results showed that with increasing drowsiness, the standard deviation of lateral position and percentage of driver eyelid closure (PERCLOS) increased significantly. Consideration of these variables can thus improve the accuracy of drowsy driving detection. The developed MOL-TCE model was compared with a non-TCE MOL and a TCE mixed generalized ordered response (MGOR) model. The drowsiness detection accuracy of the MOL-TCE model was 62.84%, higher than the 61.04% accuracy of the MGOR-TCE and appreciably higher than the 52.47% of the non-TCE MOL model."}

A thorough experimental protocol was established to induce systematic variability in affective states (neutral, relaxed and stressed/anxious) through a variety of external and internal stressors. The analysis was focused mainly on non-voluntary and semi-voluntary facial cues in order to estimate the emotion representation more objectively. Features under investigation included eye-related events, mouth activity, head motion parameters and heart rate estimated through camera-based photoplethysmography. A feature selection procedure was employed to select the most robust features followed by classification schemes discriminating between stress/anxiety and neutral states with reference to a relaxed state in each experimental phase. In addition, a ranking transformation was proposed utilizing self reports in order to investigate the correlation of facial parameters with a participant perceived amount of stress/anxiety. The results indicated that, specific facial cues, derived from eye activity, mouth activity, head movements and camera based heart activity achieve good accuracy and are suitable as discriminative indicators of stress and anxiety."}

Specific Motor Components Contribute to the Recognition of Each Emotion}, JOURNAL={Frontiers in Psychology},VOLUME={10}, PAGES={1389},YEAR={2019}, URL={https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01389}, DOI={10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01389},ISSN={1664-1078}, ABSTRACT={Are there movement features that are recognized as expressing each basic emotion by most people, and what are they? In our previous study we identified sets of Laban movement components that, when moved, elicited the basic emotions of anger, sadness, fear, and happiness. Our current study aimed to investigate if movements composed from those sets would be recognized as expressing those emotions, regardless of any instruction to the mover to portray emotion. Our stimuli included 113 video-clips of five Certified Laban Movement Analysts (CMAs) moving combinations of two to four movement components from each set associated with only one emotion: happiness, sadness, fear, or anger. Each three second clip showed one CMA moving a single combination. The CMAs moved only the combination's required components. Sixty-two physically and mentally healthy men (n = 31) and women (n = 31), ages 19–48, watched the clips and rated the perceived emotion and its intensity. To confirm participants' ability to recognize emotions from movement and to compare our stimuli to existing validated emotional expression stimuli, participants rated 50 additional clips of bodily motor expressions of these same emotions validated by Atkinson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2004</xref>). Results showed that for both stimuli types, all emotions were recognized far above chance level. Comparing recognition accuracy of the two clip types revealed better recognition of anger, fear, and neutral emotion from Atkinson's clips of actors expressing emotions, and similar levels of recognition accuracy for happiness and sadness. Further analysis was performed to determine the contribution of specific movement components to the recognition of the studied emotions. Our results indicated that these specific Laban motor components not only enhance feeling the associated emotions when moved, but also contribute to recognition of the associated emotions when being observed, even when the mover was not instructed to portray emotion, indicating that the presence of these movement components alone is sufficient for emotion recognition. This research-based knowledge regarding the relationship between Laban motor components and bodily emotional expressions can be used by dance-movement and drama therapists for better understanding of clients' emotional movements, for creating appropriate interventions, and for enhancing communication with other practitioners regarding bodily emotional expression.}}

The body movements can strongly convey emotional states than other studies.
