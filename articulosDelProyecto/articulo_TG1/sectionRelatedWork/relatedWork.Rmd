Within the context of psychosocial risk factors, some variants may be inherent individually or together in a work environment. It is essential to clarify that the environments can be external when working outdoors and internal when working indoors. The most common types of risks for both cases are: Physical risks (also known as workplace risk) refer to aspects of the environment where the work takes place. Among the most significant aspects are noise, lighting, or the temperature of the environment[@MIRZA2018][@NIELSEN2018]. Chemical risks are highly related to industrial environments where any worker may have contact with dust, gases, or abrasive products[@SHIN2014][@NIJ2017]. Biological risks involve contact with living things such as fungi, bacteria, or viruses, particularly by the interaction with people who may have a disease, infections, animals, or plants that may be carriers of a harmful organism[@CORRAO2012][@MORIKAWA2012]. Mechanical risks may be associated with some aspects of the work environment. It is related to heavy machinery usage or the development of an activity in which any person exposes to the effects of vibration [@PALMER2003][@SUNDSTRUP2017]. Environmental type risks involve scenes or work, where there is a high probability of floods, storms, or contamination[@MARSHALL2016][@ANTHONJ201934]. Finally, psychosocial risks occur in the normal execution of daily activities. These are strongly related to the work conditions, people's interaction, and socio-demographic conditions. Among the most studied aspects, it is stress, monotony, and job fatigue due to excess hours worked[@ROCHA2014][@RAFFO2014]. As this last type of risk is the main focus of the present work, section 2.1  will present the evaluation methods.

## Psychosocial Risk Assesment (PRIA) 

Currently, some methods facilitate the evaluation of FRP developed from the integration of models and scales, which seek to qualify risk factors. In works such as Charria, Sarsosa, and Arenas[@CHARRIA2011] is suggested a taxonomy of mechanisms, taking into account the form in the information extracted and its scope. In this work, there are two large groups of questionnaires oriented to industrial hygiene and psychosocial factors. In the first group, evaluates aspects such as the work environment, the physical effects on workers, and details of hiring and remuneration. The assessments of these aspects use questionnaires that are carried out by an external agent to the organization, who seeks an objective evaluation of the situation. Some examples of this group are the Questionnaire for the Fifth European Survey on Working Conditions[] and the Quality of Life at Work Survey Questionnaire[]. In the second group, there are questionnaires oriented to psychosocial factors acquired through interviews or a self-report procedure. Interview questionnaires collect information related to job satisfaction, burnout, or bullying. On the other hand, self-report questionnaires extract information related to individual aspects of the person, such as the relationship between health and illness, aspects of daily life, and their social interactions. Some examples of this second group are the EAE Stress Assessment questionnaire[], the occupational burnout scale[], the Bocanument and Berj√°n evaluation[], and the Demand-Control model[].

Concerning the groups of questionnaires mentioned, there are investigations which reveals that some conditions generate effects related to physical health such as musculoskeletal disorders[@ANDERSON1997] or the behavior of people such as sedentary lifestyle [@MORALES2014]. On the other hand, other studies show effects related to people's mood[@RHEE2017] with mental health such as stress [@AZUMA2015] and psychological disorders such as anxiety [@WIEGNER2015] or depression [@LUCA2014] [@WINSOR2016]. Although the psychosocial risk is widely related to work, it is not exclusive to these environments. Researches such as that of Abdullah Alotaibi [@ABDULLAH2020], Christian Hederich[@HEDERICH2016], and Malarvili[@MALARVILI2018] address the relationship between sleep quality and stress in academic settings. Within the research carried out in the academic context, There are studies of the prevalence and correlation of depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies such as Eisenberg's [@EISENBERG2007]. Other approaches, such as Danuta's[@ZARZYCKA2014], seek to identify the relationship of demographic aspects such as the students' place of residence as intervening variables in their state of health. It is also essential to show that in these scenarios, students are not the only actors prone to risk factors. Works such as that of Briones[@BRIONES2010] and Pedditzi[@PEDDITZI2014] show a presence of stress and job exhaustion among teachers.

During the last years, many mechanisms have been developed in the form of questionnaires. These mechanisms have favored the improvement of interactions at work, the conditions of their organization, as well as the worker's abilities, needs, culture, and the personal situation outside of work, all of which, through perceptions and experiences, can influence health and performance and job satisfaction. However, the influence not only comes from the work environment[@IZQUIERDO2012] but also from the extra-work environment[@JIN2017]. In this last aspect, psychosocial assessment methods seek to evaluate aspects such as time away from work activities, family relationships, the economy of the family group, commuting to work, among others. Some derivations or generalizations of the exposed evaluation methods have contributed to the improvement of well-being and good practices in the academic context, promoted or the development of a mechanism for the promise of stress management evidenced in Collen's work[@COLLEN2013]. Other contributions have allowed approaches to identify the behaviors associated with happiness, well-being, and the stress perceived in university students[@CALDERON2019].

The diversity of scenarios where evaluation methods play an essential role, in turn, entails a series of challenges of experimental validation, in which the aim is to establish correlation values of the aspects evaluated with the real scenario[@RUBIO-CASTRO2015] or its factor structure[@BLANCH2010]. Although there is high statistical support for several of the items raised within the questionnaires, it can be evidenced that the mechanisms and procedures are susceptible to variability and subjectivity in the measures[@CAICOYA2004][@RICK2000]. Experimentations have the caveat that samples are related to a particular segment of the population. Also, some items in questionnaires assess relevant aspects of daily activities that are not observed by specialists in occupational safety and health that a. This last issue reduces the amount of evidence drastically to establish reference values[@BENAVIDES2002].

## Technologic approaches supporting PRIA

Some references have addressed some aspects related to the mental health of people in the workplace[@CHOI2018][@GOLONKA2019]. Some of these works have resulted in technological solutions for monitoring some specific aspects of psychosocial risk, ranging from the implementation of load controls on the extremities and other parts of the body based on sensors[@HUANG2012]. Other approaches focus on reducing accidents by detecting elements or obstacles that can generate an accident. Among these approaches, works that identify liquid spills or tools oriented to the environment can be noted[@SEO2012]. On the other hand, to identify aspects related to the mental condition in people, approaches have been made through the use of artificial intelligence and computer vision. In some of these approaches, electroencephalogram images analysis is used to assess stress in people[@JEBELLI2018]. Other works such as those by Zack Zhu[@ZHU2016] or Raffaele Gravina[@GRAVINA2019], suggest alternative perspectives, based on the recognition of mood, from the capture of signals with portable electronic devices.

Other approaches address the capture and integration with other data sources, resulting in multimodal architectures[@MAGDIN2016][@SOLEYMANI2017], in which the processing of video images, text, signals, among others, is used to support the diagnosis of emotions[@HARLEY2015]. Works such as that of Le Yang[@YANG2017] and Poria Soujana[@PORIA2017] suggest the fusion of paralinguistic analysis, capturing interview responses, features of the face widely addressed[@JAIN2018][@ZHU2018], and eye movement[@ALGHOWINEM2018]. Some approaches are oriented to detect the effects of psychosocial risk factors, such as stress by performance demands[@DINGES2005] and depression.

Although these advances represent significant potential for the manufacturing industry, construction, among others[@REID2017], there are studies such as that of Shall Mark[@SCHALL2018], where there is evidence of limitations for its adoption, the implications of cost; the interruption of work activities, the intrusive nature represented in the discomfort with the devices and the privacy of people.

In these approaches, a significant contribution is evident in the analysis of voice patterns, and some aspects of interest are addressed within the evaluation of FRP. However, the video mode used in the posts above, focuses only on facial recognition, requiring the close-up capture of people's faces and the use of sensors. Also, constant monitoring considered.
